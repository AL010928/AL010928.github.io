        I am learning data visualization. More specifically (since we are all capable to creating charts in excel), I am 
        learning how to build single secure channels that links a data visualization output right back to the raw data. This involves learning:
            1. The philosophy behind a more modern approach to data visualization (visualization as a form of data, transparency, reproducibility, Tufte, Albers etc)
            2. How to use vega-lite to create charts (I might also explore R later)
            3. How to embed them and style them on a website (and therefore learning html, css, and javascript)
    </h3>
    <h3 class="small">
        What this means is that all the visualizations that I make are open source! The raw data and the JSON code to create the charts are all 
        publically available on my Github.

        The following are some of my works so far. Thanks for checking it out!
