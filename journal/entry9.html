        <h1>1.</h1>
        <p>Home. There really ought to be several different words for that, one for the place and one for the people, because after 
            enough years a person's relation to their town becomes more and more like a marriage. Both are held te gether by stories
            of what we have in common, the little things no one else knows about, the private jokes that only we think are funny, and
            that very particular laugh that you only laugh for me. Falling in love with a place and falling in love with a person 
            are related adventures. At first we run around street corners giggling and explore every inch of each other's skin, over
            the years we get to know every cobblestone and strand of hair and snore, and the waters of time soften our passion into 
            unfailing love, and in the end the eyes we wake up next to and the horizon outside our window are the same thing: home.

            So there ought to be two words for that, one for the home which can carry you through your darkest moments, and one for 
            the home which binds you. Because sometimes we stay in towns and marriages simply because we would otherwise have no 
            story. We have to much in common. We think no one else would be able to understand us.</p>
        <h1>2.</h1>
        <p>"Marriage".</p>

        <p>There ought to be a different word for it once you've been married for enough years. When you've long since passed the 
            point where it stopped feeling like a choice. I no longer choose you every morning, that was a beautiful thing we said 
            on our wedding day, I just can't imagine life without you now. We aren't freshly blooming flowers, we're two trees with 
            intertwined roots, you've grown old within me. </p>

        <p>When you're young you believe that love is infatuation, but infatuation is simple, any child can become infatuated, fall 
            in love. But real love? Love is a job for an adult. Love demands a whole person, all the best of you, all the worst. It 
            has nothing to do with romance, because the hard part of a marriage isn't that I have to live seeing all your faults, 
            but that you have to live with me seeing them. That I know everything about you now. Most people aren't brave enough to 
            live without secrets. Everyone dreams about being invisible sometimes, no one dreams of being transparent. </p>

        <p> Marriage? There ought to be a different word for it after a while. Because there's no such thing as "eternal infatuation,"
            only love lasts that long, and it's never simple. It requires a whole person, everything you have. The whole lot.</p>

        <p>There really ought to be a different word for marriage, but perhaps also a different word for divorce. One for when you're only 
            almost there. When you want to whisper that I don't know what I want, I just don't want it to be like this. A word for 
            simply saying that I can't bear it. I can't bear it if all we're going to do with each other is just baer it. </p>
        
        <p>"I...Peter, I...," she begins, and all the oxygen goes out of the room.</p>

        <p>She says "Peter," not "darling," and she pauses just long enough for him not to let her finish the sentence. So he quickly
            leans his forehead close to hers and whispers: </p>
        
        <p>"I love you!"</p>

        <p>Her smile comes so fast, caught by the intensity in his eyes, his breath so close to hers, and then she says the same thing
            with such obviousness that they can both pretend she had never come close to saying anything different:</p>
        
        <p>"I love you too."</p>

        <p>It's been so long since they said that, but now it's very recent. Above all the other words for love, there ought to be
            one for this: one that says how many times we've come clsoe to losing each other but turn back and start again. One for
            the very small things, the inches, when we brush past each other in the kitchen instead of only almost doing it. 
            Something that says I can't bear it. I can't bear it if you can't bear me. I can't bear it without you. </p>
        <p>They set off for the funeral together and he doesn't let go of her hand the whole way.</p>
