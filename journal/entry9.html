        <h1>1.</h1>
        <p>Home. There really ought to be several different words for that, one for the play and one for the people, because after 
            enough years a person's relation to their town becomes more and more like a marriage. Both are held te gether by stories
            of what we have in common, the little things no one else knows about, the private jokes that only we think are funny, and
            that very particular laugh that you only laugh for me. Falling in love with a place and falling in love with a person 
            are related adventures. At first we run around street corners giggling and explore every inch of each other's skin, over
            the years we get to know every cobblestone and strand of hair and snore, and the waters of time soften our passion into 
            unfailing love, and in the end the eyes we wake up next to and the horizon outside our window are the same thing: home.

            So there ought to be two words for that, one for the home which can carry you through your darkest moments, and one for 
            the home which binds you. Because sometimes we stay in towns and marriages simply because we would otherwise have no 
            story. We have to much in common. We think no one else would be able to understand us.</p>
