        <h1>2024/06/29: A Simple Model for Online Message Discipline</h1>
        <p>Same vibe as building a model using Taylor Swift ticket sales to predict next quarter inflation.... read with caution.</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The idea that I'm concerned with is this: In political discussions, leftists should moderate their speech to 
            appear less off-putting and less provocative, in the hopes of building an effective coalition. It is in the 
            genre of respectability in politics: for example, abolishing prisons seems like a radical idea. Therefore if 
            you start with a full speech filled with vocabularies such as abolition, exploitation, disproprotionally 
            affecting people of colour, then to the uninitiative ear this will appear off-putting right away and hence 
            stands in the way of effective coalition building. </p>

        <p>I'm not a fan of this genre, and there are at least 2 reasons, I'll focus on the last. </p>

        <p>Some preliminary notes before I go in. I think that my arguments against speech discipline apply for only some people.
            Specifically, it applies to regular people discussing and talking in the context of social media/in real life. It does
            not apply to people 1)with a platform, nor does it apply to 2)1-1 conversations where there is already established trust 
            between the parties. Further, it will not apply to people who do not believe in the implicit assumption of the original 
            argument, which is that your ultimate goal is leftist victories. This will rule out, for example, journalists,
            whose role, you can argue, is properly distinct from seeking partisan political victories. This caveat aside,
            here are the reason why I think that speech discipline is a bad idea.</p>
        
        <h2>Argument</h2>
        <p>The first reason: Too much Machiavellian playing with expression, action, and preferencees can be at odds with how we should conduct 
            in a democracy. It is perfectly possible that the above genre leads to democratic preference aggregation that do
            not take into account the full range of sentiments and knowledge that is within the society. I believe that this is true to some extent,
            but I'll leave my thinking on this aside for now. </p>

        <p>The second reason: Suppose that this is the situation faced by our typical postmodern neo-Marxist serpent: they come across a
             discourse where they are faced with the decision of speaking their political minds, or moderating their speech.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> In general, our protagonist prefers speaking their minds to not speaking their 
                    minds.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> For simplification (though nothing depends upon this simplification), our 
                    protagonist would rather the left win (more supporters for a bill, popular opinion, what not). But 
                    if moderating their speech would change a result from losing to winning, they would rather moderate 
                    their speech.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption 3:</strong>As an individual, they will not be able to change other people's opinion of the Left
                    as a whole (critiques of them will always other people to protray as unreasonable). Now it
                    turns out that our results depends significantly on this, but expansion+justification later. </p>
        <p>Hence, we have a decision model as follows:</p>

        <!-- Game Matrix Table -->
        <div class="game-matrix">
            <table>
                <caption>Game Matrix: Online Message Discipline</caption>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Left Win</th>
                    <th>Left Lose</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Speaking Mind</th>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Message Discipline</th>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>A simple dominance argument would suffice to show that it is always better to speak your minds. As mentioned before, 
            the results turn on the assumption that you cannot change the outcome based on your conducts online. I beleive that 
            for most of us, this is true.</p>
        <p>But let's now consider a more complicated scenario: what if you are able to influence the results? Again, I do not think
            that this is true for most people, but you would have some sort of influecen if you are, let's say, someone with
            a platform. I'll call this <a href="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1057/978-1-349-95121-5_1690-2">act-state dependence:</a> 
            one's action affect the probability of one world state happening over the other.</p>
