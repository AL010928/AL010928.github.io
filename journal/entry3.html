        <h1>2024/06/29: A Simple Model for Online Message Discipline</h1>
        <p>Same vibe as using Taylor Swift ticket sales to predict inflation.... read with caution.</p>
        <p>The idea that I'm concerned with is this: leftists should speak and act in a fashion that is less off putting and less provocative, in the hopes of building an effective coalition.</p>
        <p>Suppose that this is the situation faced by our typical postmodern neo-Marxist serpent (now it turns out that our results depends significantly on this, but expansion+justification later): they come across a discourse where they are faced with the decision of speaking their political minds, or moderating their speech.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption 1:</strong> In general, our protagonist prefers speaking their minds to not speaking their minds.</p>
        <p><strong>Assumption 2:</strong> For simplification (though nothing depends upon this simplification), our protagonist would rather the left win (more supporters for a bill, popular opinion, what not). But if moderating their speech would change a result from losing to winning, they would rather moderate their speech.</p>
        <p>Hence, we have a decision model as follows:</p>

        <!-- Game Matrix Table -->
        <div class="game-matrix">
            <table>
                <caption>Game Matrix: Online Message Discipline</caption>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Left Win</th>
                    <th>Left Lose</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Speaking Mind</th>
                    <td>4</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Message Discipline</th>
                    <td>3</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <p>A simple dominance argument would suffice to show that it is always better to speak your minds.</p>
