        <h1>2025/04/11: Letter to Zimo</h1>
        <p>Zimo, I’m back in Vancouver after spending some time in London. It’s been a complicated mix of emotions and thoughts 
            since coming back. </p>
        <p>During my primary school years, something that I used to do was to climb up on a tree. The trees in the boarding school 
            were different—unlike the grand oaks and maples here, those trees were climbable. They spread out horizontally like 
            reaching out for hugs, and they provided just enough height that if you get to the top, people walking underneath 
            wouldn’t notice you. Not that that mattered—the boarding school was large enough that nobody ever came to the corner 
            that I frequented. I used to climb to the very top, and pretended like I was the only one on this earth. I am never 
            afraid when I’m by myself. I did that all the way until high school, the only difference was that I had access to 
            substances, and a simple climb upgraded to a climb and a smoke. </p>

        <p>I succeeded temporally in being entangled with this world after, which meant that the loneliness that I felt as a kid 
            diminished somewhat. None of the good things felt unshakable at any point, but they were enough that I was living day to
            day grateful for what I had. I had less urge to close my eyes and pretend that I’m alone. Those silent moments got 
            replaced by action: action to reorganize my lecture notes, action to play badminton with friends, action to go pick 
            up groceries so I can make dinner with my mom. </p>

        <p>Zimo, in your last reply, you noted that I sounded again like a tumbleweed in this world. I think that I indeed started 
            to feel like that again. My heart feels heavy—I’m not sure where I’ll be, in terms of geographical location, careers, 
            friendships, romantic relationships, and family. And I started to vulnerable in this world again. Back to what I said 
            earlier: I’m never afraid when I’m by myself, only when I’m entangled in a deep sense. And Zimo, I think being in love 
            has a way of making me feel vulnerable again, not only in the context of the relationship, but it makes me more 
            vulnerable to the world in general. Big City told Benji that nobody travels that far away unless they are trying to 
            find something. I wonder if that’s the reason why I intuitively wanted to move to Montreal for my undergrad, and why I 
            moved again to London for my masters. I think I just wish to find a place or someone that makes me feel like home. </p>

        <p>In any case, I want to hear from you, and I will send you pictures of the early spring blossoms here in Vancouver. They 
            are things that allow me to put the weight down temporarily. I hope that they do the same for you. </p>

        <p>Best,</p>
        <p>Ava</p>
