        <h1>2025/03/06: Anora</h1>
        <p>"《阿诺拉》没有想象力，肖恩·贝克觉得自己可以仅凭最扁平的假象来书写真实，于是他不对场景做出任何创造，他用最典型、最照搬刻板印象的选段来推动场景：发生在豪宅里的只有性交易，发生在夜店里的只有从音乐到镜头的泄欲，富二代和叛逆青年可以随意侵占公共空间，类似于在糖果店说“这里的老板老糊涂了，又聋又瞎”，这些假暗讽、真现眼的桥段连番膨胀，唯一的裂缝，也只是阿诺拉语焉不详的表情，但这根本没有力度。然后以富二代的出逃为引子，理所当然地换上另一副面具，理所当然地走上田野调查，采集一些最单薄的漫画，一些不包含真实性格的社群生态，这既不是现实的纽约，也不是电影的纽约。"</p>
        <p>"包括《阿诺拉》的整个视觉，看起来很独立但真的很无趣，就像那些不稳定画面串联出的段落，它们的推升像最机械的浏览；广角镜头里的巨富豪宅、纽约大马路的风景画，都带着油滑的造型感；而很多被无限延长的混乱碎片，不是依赖造作的走位（例如夜店里的舞女一个接一个跑出去看打架），就是放弃对动作的精确捕捉，而陷入一片狼藉，而那种狼藉仍然是景观。",</p>
        <p>I can see and agree that Anora is a bit visually lazy (a great contrast being Uncut Gems), I think the screenplay is actually well-written. At its core, the entire script boils down to those final three lines about the car. <i>Nothing is true, and everything is possible.</i> This is the terrifying reality of post-Soviet Russians in New York.</p>
        <p>On the surface, the film can presents itself as cliché—its themes, its plot cliché, its performances are cliché (especially the rich kid’s mother), and certain of its dialogues are cliché. And yet, it has something that moves you (or at least me). If you try to interpret it as a deep reflection on class issues, global problems, or some politically correct support for the disadvantaged—if that's why the Oscars are awarding it—then it doesn't fully hold up. It’s not quite Oscar-worthy. The biggest thought I had while watching was: How could a stripper possibly take a rich kid’s drunken promises seriously? And yet, she did. And at some point, even the rich kid started taking it seriously. So did the bodyguards. Everyone convinced themselves that what they were doing was real. But life, vast and indifferent like an empty street at night, leaves them with only one solace: taking it seriously and believing in certain parts of it. And I think that for a lot of people, it makes life more bearable. I sympathized with the kind-hearted bodyguard. I also sympathized with the rich kid, who seemed to have more ways out.</p>
