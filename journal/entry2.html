        <h1>2022/09/26: Letter to Zimo</h1>
        <p>Zimo,</p>
        <p>Another autumn has arrived in the blink of an eye. To be precise, it's already autumn where you are, but here, it’s still the height of summer. The air is humid, and it’s been raining recently. I forgot my umbrella when I went out, so I took shelter in a café halfway up a hill and started writing this letter to you. Summer feels sticky; my clothes are often soaked in sweat and cling to me. Yet, I don’t find it unpleasant. This city has the trees I love—lush and verdant, with thick, tall trunks. Especially the one I came across while searching for a bookstore the other day. It grew in an old residential area, and I liked it so much that I took a photo to capture the moment. Beneath the tree, a young Southeast Asian woman was gently stroking two black-and-white cats.</p>

        <p>You mentioned that you’re about to leave Europe, feeling that your time there has come to an end. I support your decision. Though I can’t fully grasp every moment of your life or empathize with your feelings about that city, I also sense that leaving might be the better choice for you. You deserve to find a place that’s more fitting. Have you decided where to go?</p>

        <p>Lately, I’ve been wandering around the city. There are so many bookstores, cafés, art shops, and exhibitions here. Sometimes, even without intention, I stumble upon breathtaking sights that reflect humanity and care. A friend recommended a bookstore to me the other day, but I couldn’t join them due to timing. Yesterday, I wasn’t planning to go there either, but as I was walking, I suddenly looked up and found myself right in front of it. I felt it was destined, so I stepped inside and spent some time there. Later, I discovered that this bookstore regularly distributes free food to those in need. I don’t know how profitable such a bookstore can be, or if it can even turn a profit, but the owner persists nonetheless. When I walked in, I saw him calmly organizing the shelves, unhurried. There weren’t many customers, but he didn’t seem concerned.</p>

        <p>I paused while writing this letter because the rain had stopped, and I needed to catch the subway home to avoid getting caught in it again. Picking up the pen again now, it’s 7:30 the next morning. Damn....I again didn’t sleep all night. I’ve been staying up late lately—perhaps it’s because the nights here are too bright. They always feel fleeting, and before I realize it, it’s already 2 or 3 a.m. In your letter, you mentioned arriving in London. I wonder if I'll ever get the chance to live there. In my mind, London’s skies are always gloomy, with only occasional glimpses of sunlight. But when it was sunny, the city would be dazzlingly beautiful in a surprising way. I don't feel particularly attached to London—a city that captivates so many doesn't enchant me. Still, I think you’ll enjoy your time there. It will bring you a fresh start.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, I feel like I’m drifting through life, like duckweed. It’s not because of loneliness. Rather, it’s as if I’m less entangled with the world. At the same time, I seem to have lost the fleeting joys those entanglements once brought, even if they were ephemeral and illusory. Of course, this means I’ve also reduced my chances of experiencing transient, false pains. I’m unsure if this is a phase one must go through, but since it’s happening to me, I’ve decided to embrace it. Sometimes, I’m startled by the changes I’ve undergone, often noticing them only after the fact. They’re irreversible. Returning to old ways of thinking and habits feels as futile as trying to charge a phone with an incompatible plug. I’m gradually teaching myself to adapt.</p>

        <p>Zimo, as you know, even though we’ve reconciled with ourselves and the universe, we cannot blindfold ourselves and pretend we live in a just world. Humanity deserves a more peaceful, kind, warm, and inclusive world—one that can only be achieved through human effort.</p>

        <p>It’s 9:30 a.m. now, and I finally gave in to sleep. When I woke up in the afternoon, I had a simple meal and went to Kennedy town right by the sea. I like it because the view is so gorgeous, and you can go right up to the edge of the water by the cliffs. This is where I am writing this letter now. The place where I live is culturally diverse; this restaurant seems to be run by Europeans. Sometimes, I feel that simply doing nothing and watching the cityscape is already wonderful.</p>

        <p>Lately, I’ve been deeply immersed in Pali classics. Calling it an obsession wouldn’t be an exaggeration. I’ve uncovered wisdom in those texts that has been severely underestimated or even overlooked by the intellectual world. I’m glad I’ve moved beyond my cultural background to develop an interest in broader knowledge—people tend to gravitate toward what’s familiar to their heritage. But I won’t delve into my discoveries here, in case you find them uninteresting. I just wanted to share my joy with you because I feel intellectually liberated. It’s inspiring to realize that there’s no fixed path and yet so much knowledge to pursue. However, I’m not overly concerned about life plans right now.</p>

        <p>In your last letter, you described an odd experience. Sitting in a café near King’s College, you saw a tree and the falling leaves, smelled the damp air, and felt as if you’d suddenly been transported to my city. Reading that, I also felt as though we were living in the same space. It moved me. I don’t know what’s calling you. I don’t know how long I’ll stay in this city either. Your letter has, in some way, soothed me again. It made me feel that no matter what lies ahead, it doesn’t really matter.</p>

        <p>Best wishes,</p>
        <p>Ava</p>
