        <h1>2025/10/07</h1>

        <p>This director is one of the least Macho flavoured male directors in Chinese cinema. It’s probably because the men in his films possess such little traditional masculinity—faint, sensitive, neurotic, and easily wounded. Leslie Cheung cries under covers; Takeshi Kaneshiro zoning out while eating a tin of pineapples; Tony Leung’s eyes filled with unspoken words—even Andy Lau’s policeman in Days of Being Wild is utterly non-aggressive, simply pacing beneath Maggie Cheung’s apartment in a quiet heartbreak. There are never hysterically masculine men in his films. </p>
        <p>The women, on the other hand, come in infinite forms—seductive and elegant, lively and spontaneous, distant and self-possessed, or mysterious and unreachable. The balance of power between men and women makes these relationships believable, while suffusing them with beauty. 
</p>
        <p>The people in his films are always lonely and adrift, loving without being loved back, smoking in silence, endlessly searching for something, but always losing something, trapped in a Babel of their language, unable to find their roots. The wounds they bear knows no gender. </p>
