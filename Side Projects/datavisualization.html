        I am learning data visualization. More specifically (since we are all capable to creating charts in excel), I am 
        learning how to build single secure channels that links a data visualization output right back to the raw data. This involves learning: <br>
            1. The philosophy behind a more modern approach to data visualization (visualization as a form of data, transparency, reproducibility, Tufte, Albers etc) <br>
            2. How to use vega-lite to create charts (I might also explore R later)<br>
            3. How to embed them and style them on a website (and therefore learning html, css, and javascript)<br>
    
        What this means is that all the visualizations that I make are open source! The raw data and the JSON code to create the charts are all 
        publically available on my Github.<br><br>

        The following are some of my works so far. Thanks for checking it out!

    <!-- I'm organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>1. GDP against life expectancy</h2>
            <p> 
                Both data and chart files are from the economics observatory. I simply link to it here.
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="Location1"></figure> <!-- give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->

    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>2. UK Output per hour</h2>
            <p> 
                This line chart showing UK output per hour from 1997 to 2024. <br>
                This is my first pass at using vega-lite to create a JSON chart file. The data used for the chart comes from ONS. Both the csv (data file) and json (chart spec) can be found in my github repo.
